				These Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect while you use
				the Service. WITHOUT LIMITING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THESE TERMS OF USE,
				WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION AND WITHOUT NOTICE OR
				LIABILITY, DENY ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE Service (INCLUDING BLOCKING
				CERTAIN IP ADDRESSES), TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY REASON OR FOR NO REASON,
				INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FOR BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY,

				REGULATION. WE MAY TERMINATE YOUR USE OR PARTICIPATION IN THE Service OR
				DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT AND ANY CONTENT OR INFORMATION THAT YOU POSTED AT
				ANY TIME, WITHOUT WARNING, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION.
			</p>
			<h3>Modifications and Interruptions</h3>
			<p>
				We reserve the right to change, modify, or remove the contents of the
				Service at any time or for any reason at our sole discretion without
				notice. However, we have no obligation to update any information on our
				Service. We also reserve the right to modify or discontinue all or part
				of the Service without notice at any time. We will not be liable to you
				or any third party for any modification, price change, suspension, or
				discontinuance of the Service.
			</p>
			<p>
				We cannot guarantee the Service will be available at all times. We may
				experience hardware, software, or other problems or need to perform
				maintenance related to the Service, resulting in interruptions, delays,
				or errors. We reserve the right to change, revise, update, suspend,

				construed to obligate us to maintain and support the Service or to
				supply any corrections, updates, or releases in connection therewith.
			</p>
			<h3>Governing Law</h3>
			<p>
				These Terms of Use and your use of the Service are governed by and
				construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Singapore
				applicable to agreements made and to be entirely performed within the
				Republic of Singapore, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
			</p>
			<h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>
			<p>
				Informal Negotiations To expedite resolution and control the cost of any
				dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms of Use (each
				"Dispute" and collectively, the "Disputes") brought by either you or us
				(individually, a "Party" and collectively, the "Parties"), the Parties
				agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes
				expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days
				before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon
				written notice from one Party to the other Party.
			</p>
			<h3>Binding Arbitration</h3>
			<p class="nobo">
				If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal
				negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded
				below) will be finally and exclusively resolved through binding
				arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE
				THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall
				be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
				Singapore International Arbitration Centre ("SIAC") and, where
				appropriate, the SIAC's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related
				Disputes ("SIAC Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the
				SIAC website:https://www.seer.eco . Your arbitration fees and your share
				of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the SIAC Consumer Rules
				and, where appropriate, limited by the SIAC Consumer Rules. If such
				costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, we will pay all
				arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in
				person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The
				arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a
				statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator
				must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the
				arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the
				applicable SIAC rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place
				in the Republic of Singapore. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
				Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings
				pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on
				the award entered by the arbitrator.
			</p>
			‍
			<p>
				If for any reason the dispute proceeds in court rather than in
				arbitration, the dispute shall be brought or prosecuted in a court
				located in the Republic of Singapore, and the parties hereby agree and
				waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non
				conveniens with respect to the venue and jurisdiction of such
				court.Application of the Convention on Contracts for the International
				Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act
				(UCITA) is excluded from these Terms of Use.
			</p>
			‍
			<p>
				If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither
				Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of
				this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable, and such Dispute
				shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts
				listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the
				personal jurisdiction of that court.
			</p>
			<h3>Restrictions</h3>
			<p>
				The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute
				between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law,
				(a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there
				is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a
				class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there
				is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported
				representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other
				persons.
			</p>
			<h3>Corrections</h3>
			<p>
				There may be information on the Service that contains typographical
				errors, inaccuracies, or omissions, including descriptions, pricing,
				availability, and various other information. We reserve the right to
				correct any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions and to change or update
				the information on the Service at any time, without prior notice.
			</p>
