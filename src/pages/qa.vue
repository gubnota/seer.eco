		<pre>
<strong>1. What is SEER</strong>
SEER is a collection of social value discovery protocols that connect hundreds of millions of Web3 social users and are based on the user identity value system；It includes equity NFT, decentralized identity (DID), the world's first ads protocol, DAO governance and decentralized data storage that can be implemented within the platform, and E2E's real-time standard communications protocol.
It enables innovative Web3 applications by establishing a matrix of asset tags and behavioral tags of users' on-chain identities, which can provide accurate feedback to Web3 users.

<strong>2. What eco-products does SEER have?</strong>
SEER the ecology of SEER consists of five main components;  the distributed communication protocol of Web3 (encrypted end-to-end communication), the powerful application scenario of DAO, the decentralized identity DID (exclusive Web3 user identities), the AOE\ADS protocol (accurate curation platform and user) and the Social Graph protocol.

<strong>3. Why should I use SEER?</strong>
SEER is an innovative social value discovery protocol that offers far more convenience and economic benefits than Web2 Social. SEER provides military-grade E2E social capabilities, DAO community governance capabilities, mainstream DAPP social plugin capabilities, and an on-chain identity aggregation value system, as well as cross-chain multifunctional aggregation and on-chain tag data pipeline push capabilities. In terms of revenue, NFT users can earn a range of benefits, including curation revenue, community governance and voting rights, etc., while regular users can earn accurate CPC revenue based on SEER ads.
 
<strong>4. What is SDID?</strong>
SDID is a middleware protocol for an open social stack and a decentralized domain name protocol. SDID uses .web3 as a suffix domain name to provide Web3 users with an aggregate for capturing values as well as a readable digital identity. SDID can be used as an aggregation tool for values in the user chain and also as credentials for future Web3 applications, a  "passport" to the future Web3.
 
<strong>5. How to get an SDID?</strong>
To get an SDID, you can visit the official website: <a href="https://sdid.seer.eco" target="_blank">https://sdid.seer.eco/#/</a> for online Mint.
	Detailed instructions about Mint can be found in our tutorial: <a href="https://medium.com/@SeerFoundation/sdid-domain-name-free-mint-tutorial-general-version-a279d766c4d" target="_blank">https://medium.com/@SeerFoundation/sdid-domain-name-free-mint-tutorial-general-version-a279d766c4d</a> 
Soon, any user will be able to  register a domain name on SEER permanently for free.

<strong>6. What are the benefits of holding an SDID for me?</strong>

The SDID is your future Web3 digital identity that can aggregate your identity information together and form a specific tag. It has a variety of application scenarios in the future, not only as a receiving account for crypto assets, but also as credentials for a trusted Web3 application. As the application continues to gain popularity, it can become a common ID in the Web3 world. More importantly, users with a SDID will be important builders of the SEER ecology in the future and receive token airdrop and other ecosystem benefits in return.


<strong>7. What are the characteristics of the social product of SEER? What are its advantages?</strong>
SEER Social is a powerful Web3 social product that offers the following services:

  1. support for wallet address login–a native WEB3 application scenario.
  2. end-to-end encrypted communication.
  3. project stakeholders and influencers can freely create and manage very powerful areas and rooms.
  4. DAO governance for Web3 project communities.
  5. DID social genealogy.
  6. ADS: accurate display service for projects and users.
 The advantage of Seer Social is that it can solve the problems of high operation cost and low efficiency of Web3 community operators, the inaccurate and insufficient information gathered by Web3 advertisers, and the difficulty of accurate user acquisition, etc. Seer Social brings the core of Web3 to the social domain and provides convenience and economic value far beyond Web2 Social.

<strong>8. What are the wealth effects of SEER?</strong>
SEER truly realizes social value by providing revenue channels to users through dynamic NFT yields and the ADS curation effect. Users can earn revenue by viewing ads in the advertising curation section of SEER. Based on users' identity and portrait on the chain, Seer helps users find accurate value information, secure the right to participate in quality projects, and earn their due share of revenue based on their value and contribution.
Secondly, based on the service node, NFT warrants can get the beta gain of AOE、ADS allocation, the alpha gain of attraction, the premium right of PFP and so on. SEER tokens are also the hidden code of great wealth and will continue to increase in value as the ecosystem of SEER develops.

<strong>9. About SEER tokens</strong>
SEER aims to build a permissionless, open, native Web3.0 protocol for social value discovery. SEER tokens are a core component of such an infrastructure, acting as governance tokens to incentivize user participation, as credentials to circulate ecological value, and as payment tokens to promote spatial activities in the SEER platform to gain more attention.It has the beauty of a self-running economic model. The total supply of SEER is 100,000,000 tokens.

<strong>10. What is AOE?</strong>
AOE (Area Of Effect) is a paid advertising and marketing tool tailored for brand owners. It plays an important role in SEER ecology. It helps brands upgrade through public domain curation and introduce targeted users to the community. AOE selects and gathers valuable Web3 users in the public domain through blockchain data algorithm, which can greatly help brands increase their exposure and capture and retain more users through their marketing activities. It has become an indispensable value marketing tool, a must for all SEER brands.

<strong>11. What is ADS?</strong>
ADS is an important advertising and marketing protocol of SEER. Like AOE, it is an advertising and marketing tool tailored by SEER for brands. It offers precise positioning, flexible advertisement and high conversion rates. Therefore, it is one of the favorite advertising tools for brand owners. ADS focuses on tier 1 Web3 users, so it can bring precise and high-value Web3 users to brand owners. ADS provides brand owners with users that precisely match their user portraits. Through such precise curation of ADS, brands can further expand their influence.

<strong>12. What is the DAO proposal?</strong>
To build a fair and reasonable community, the governance of SEER DAO is automatically executed by smart contracts. In SEER DAO, decisions are made through voting on community proposals, which include technology upgrades, product innovation, market operation, token governance, etc. Each proposal is key to the future development of the community. If a proposal is voted by the jury, it will be incorporated into the future development plan for implementation.

<strong>13. What is gating?</strong>
Gating is an important function of SEER for community space governance. It can help the Web3 community to conduct hierarchical governance and preserve the unity of community users. By setting different gating strategies, it can effectively control and select the liquidity behavior of community members. For example; if the community is a BAYC community, it will assign users to different rooms through their equity ratings. The function of gating is to accurately select and manage target users by setting thresholds. If you are a BAYC holder, then you will be able to enter the room, or if you were a BAYC holder, you can also enter the room. Otherwise, you cannot enter. The specific policy criteria vary according to the needs of the space creator.

<strong>14. What is the treasury</strong>
The treasury is a financial strategy formulated by SEER for the development of the global Web3 community and DAO organizations. The current financial situation of the global Web3 community is very well. To facilitate effective fund management by the DAO community, SEER supports different organizations within the DAO by adding treasuries. It provides a great way of on-chain fund review, usage, supervision, and KYC compliance. SEER supports the establishment and permission setting of multiple treasuries, and supports monthly billing.

<strong>15. What is DAO management?</strong>
SEER DAO refers to the decentralized autonomous organization of SEER. SEER's dynamic NFT holders have governance rights over SEER DAO, including voting rights, proposal rights, and other rights to improve community governance efficiency. Anyone can become the holder of the dynamic SEER NFT and participate in the future management and construction of SEER. The SEER DAO jury plays an important role in it, and can review the proposals of the community, especially the voting review of AOE and ADS activities.
